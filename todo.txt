ðŸŽ¯ Bonus Tip: Add schema markup later for Google Rich Results (optional)
If you're interested, I can help you mark up services and prices using Schema.org so Google can show your services in search result snippets (like a mini menu).

Maybe logo moves to the side when scrolling down. And maybe the menu 'transforms' to some side menu too.
The problem with this is in mobiles where it overlaps with elements of the sections of main
So first make the site ok for desktop/mobile without moving the logo to the side and then look at moving the logo and the menu to the side
Alternatively examine the logo moving to the side and on the same line having the menu? So now no overlap because remaining sections will always follow underneath?

Add animation
Something like this:
  animation: fadeInLogo 2s ease-out forwards;
but as of this writing if i put it in .logo in my css when the page loads it scrolls down a bit (maybe because I start with 0.75) and never scrolls back up
Although you don't want scrolling at all!


DONE

Check if google fonts work ok on iOS
